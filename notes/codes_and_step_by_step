In the brand page if we clik on the name of the brand it will take us to the page were all the products under that brand are listed so the @product.each do code  below loops over all the products and spit them out with the arguments passed eg product name, description etc -->
<ul>
  <% @products.each  do |product| %>
  <li> 
    <p class="user-name"></p> 
    <p><%= product.name %></p>
    <p><%= product.description  %></p>
    <p><%= product.image %></p>
    <p><%= product.price_retail %></p>  
  </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
To get a link of reviews and brands on the home or product page that if click will take me to the page that list all the reviews or brands pages put this code inside index.html.erb page of product

<h1>Listing Products</h1>
<%= link_to("reviews", reviews_path) %>
<%= link_to("brands", brands_path) %>
